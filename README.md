<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

NumberTap is a game where you fly as a spaceship, in space trough meteor pipes. It keeps up how many of them have you passed without hitting the pipe or if you fly over the correct answer that correlates to the equation that is given in the screen. 

Why this game is required:
* To involve all people, no matter of age, to improve their math skills, creating a solution quickly and testing yourself
* Make people to be focused longer periods as this problem is getting relevant.

The game menu contains three options: play, settings and quit, which allows a person to do some certain tasks for their comformability.


### Built With
Only built with Unity and C#, for graphics photoshop was used. No frameworks nothing else was added.

* Game Engine: Unity
* Language: C#

This section is ment to explain all of the functions that the game provides and how to use them for the user.

### Main Menu
When the game is opened a main menu pops up with three posibilities:

* Play: Turns on the game, allows the user to play the game.
* Settings: Allows the user to change the volume of the music, when pressed "back", returns to the main menu screen.
* Quit: exits the game.

### The game
#### The start of the game
At the start the menu opens. When clicked play the game starts. The user needs to tap the screen if he or she wants the character to go up. On the top of the screen is a score counter which starts with "0" and a pause button, which allows the game to be paused. 

![Pause page](https://github.com/AustejaJak/NumberTap/blob/39cf72ae2333187375bf63139beb303a03b532d6/pause.png)

On the bottom of the screen the generated equation is seen, the user will need to count the answer to the equation. But be quick, because the time is limited by the arriving pipes!

#### The pipes are coming through
When a user keeps tapping the screen after a couple of seconds the pipes fly to the character, the pipes contain two gaps in which one is correct answer to the equation on the bottom of the screen and second one is incorrect. When a user flies into the gap which has the correct answer it a score is added if he or she flies over into incorrect one the gameover screen is displayed and you are bringed to the start of the game.

![GameOver page](https://github.com/AustejaJak/NumberTap/blob/39cf72ae2333187375bf63139beb303a03b532d6/over.png)

In the gameover screen not only current score is displayd, but also your highscore, so you can track your progress and compare it with your friends.

#### The ways you can lose
* Off screen: By user flying out of the screen.
* Collision: By hitting the pipe.
* Inccorect answer: By selecting a wrong answer to a given math equation.
